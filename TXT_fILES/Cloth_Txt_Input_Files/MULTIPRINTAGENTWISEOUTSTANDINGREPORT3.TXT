; Purpose: Implements a "Multi Print Agent Wise Outstanding Report" in Tally,
;          allowing bulk printing of agent-wise outstanding statements with
;          bill-by-bill details (Dr/Cr), address, contact, and totals.
;===============================================================================

## Main Features

- **Menu Integration:**
  - Adds the report to Gateway of Tally and Debug menu for easy access.
  - Menu option: "Multi print agent wise" (labelled via `@@multiprintAGENTReport`)[1].

- **Report Structure:**
  - For each agent/party, prints a detailed outstanding statement.
  - Two main sections per party:
    - **Debit Bills (Dr):** Date, Bill No, Mode of Credit, Qty, Dr. Value.
    - **Credit Bills (Cr):** Date, Bill No, Mode of Credit, Qty, Cr. Value.
  - Each section has its own totals line.
  - Address and contact details are included at the top (company and party).
  - Page breaks and formatting for professional multi-party printing.

- **Data Model:**
  - **Debit Side (`ColmultiprintAGENT`):**
    - Type: Bills
    - Filters: Only Dr (debit) bills, agent filter always enabled.
    - Fetches agent/party custom caption (`cwcaption1item`).
    - Sorted by parent (party/agent).
  - **Credit Side (`ColmultiprintAGENTb`):**
    - Type: Bills
    - Filters: Only Cr (credit) bills, agent filter always enabled.
    - Fetches agent/party custom caption.
    - Sorted by parent.
  - Both collections ensure only relevant bills are included for each party.

- **Layout and Styling:**
  - Each party's statement is split into two vertical parts (Dr and Cr) side by side (each 50% page width).
  - Bold headers, clear alignment, and thin borders for clarity.
  - Totals at the bottom of each section.
  - Toolbar buttons for navigation, export, and print.

- **Technical Highlights:**
  - Uses TDL's `repeat`, `scroll`, and `total` features for dynamic, multi-party reporting.
  - System formulas and variables control filtering and formatting.
  - No hard-coded party names; filters are generic for all agents.
